# Text-Analysis-in-IMDB-Movie-Reviews-

**Objective**

The objective of this report is to showcase what types of aspects in a film should production companies/film makers consider when trying to create a film that generates high reviews on IMDB.

**Business and problem overview/project summary**

We hope to gather useful insights/information that will be pertinent to filmmakers or production companies because according to a report over 80% of moviegoers look at a review before attending a film in person.  The importance of this is that if a film has a negatively associated review then they will be less inclined to watch it and also vice versa with positive reviews equating to more live viewership.
